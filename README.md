** Keep your code clean according to MVVM**
-----------------------------
 - Yes , liveData is easy , powerful , but you should know how to use.
 - For livedate which will emit data stream , it has to be in your
   data layer , and don't inform those observables any thing else like
   in which thread those will consume , cause it is another
 - For livedata which will emit UI binding events, it has to be in your ViewModel Layer.
 - Observers in UI Consume and react to live data values and bind it.
   responsibility , and according to `Single responsibility principle`
  in `SOLID (object-oriented design)` , so don't break this concept by
   mixing the responsibilities .

  ### ðŸ‘‰  Why RxJava?
  -----------------------------
  
  Reactive extensions in Java allow you to manipulate multiple actions that occur due to certain system events simultaneously. Rx gives you a possibility to use
  functional transformations over streams of events and it doesn't require using nasty things like callbacks and global state management.

##### ðŸ‘‰  If You Want To Dont't Load On Ui Thread Then You Should Use Background Thread. RxJava Doing Same For That Workd.
